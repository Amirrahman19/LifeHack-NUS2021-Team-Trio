# LifeHack-NUS2021-Team-Trio

Problem Statement: 
Education
As technology rapidly infiltrates the education sector and changes not just the way people learn, but
also how people teach, what refreshing ideas do you have to make learning/teaching more safe,
exciting, and effective?

We have come up with 2 solutions that can be combined or used seperately according to the user's preference. One is a To-do list task shuffler and the other is a calender shuffler for deadlines. Both Javascript programmes ask for user input before executing the program. Ths shuffl.html file is a combination of both programmes that can be used alone.

Our solution has been presented in the form of a web-app/website. The link is provided here:
